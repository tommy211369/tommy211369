# Hello ! üëã üëã

 üöÄ On October 2020, I decided to go into the web development world 

 üíª I started with HTML / CSS & JavaScript with very helpful free online courses.target='blank'>OpenClassRooms</a>
 
 To get the dev best practises & advices, I decided to join a bootcamp : 10 weeks of intense coding, to become a Fullstack JavaScript Developer and learn how to create an app from A to Z with React Native.
 
I'm looking to collaborate with other developers on any project that can help me improve my skills and discover new things !

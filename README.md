### Hello ! 👋 👋

 🚀 On October 2020, I decided to change my career and went into the web development world

 💻 I started with HTML / CSS & JavaScript with very helpful free online courses
 
 To get the dev best practises & advices, I decided to join a bootcamp : 10 weeks of intense coding, to become a Fullstack JavaScript Developer (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, React Native)
 
I'm looking to collaborate with other developers on any project that can help me improve my skills and discover new things !
